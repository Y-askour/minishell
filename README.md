Minishell is a project that implements a basic shell program in C. The project is designed to provide a simple and minimalistic shell environment that can be used for basic command execution and shell scripting.

The project includes several source files that contain the main logic for the shell program, as well as functions for handling user input, executing commands, and managing the shell environment. The project uses the readline library to provide line editing and history capabilities, and it supports the following features:

    Basic command execution and output redirection
    Shell variables and environment management
    Built-in commands for common operations (e.g. cd, echo, etc.)
    Support for command line editing and history using the readline library

To build and run the project, you will need to have the readline library installed on your system. Once you have installed the readline library, you can clone the project repository and use the provided Makefile to build and run the project.

To run the project, you can simply execute the resulting minishell binary. This will launch the shell program, and you can then enter commands at the prompt to execute them. The shell supports basic command execution, output redirection, and the built-in commands described above.
